I have worked on a HR data analytics dashboard.

Objective:
1) Identifying the number of employees who are in due for promotion and not due for promotion based on their years of service.
2) The company is going to retrench the employees who are having 15 years of service. So, we have to examine the employees who have completed more than 15 years in the company.
